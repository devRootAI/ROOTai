# Fork.AI

## 🌟 Introduction

The **Fork.AI* is a powerful Node.js CLI application designed to streamline application development. With this tool, you can:

- Leverage API documentation (`openai.json`) to understand the system you’re building against.
- Specify the exact functionality you want.
- Automatically generate complete application code using OpenAI’s capabilities.
  
Whether you're building chatbots, integrations, or full-fledged applications, this tool is your AI-powered developer assistant.

## ✨ Features

- **Interactive CLI**: Simple, user-friendly prompts to guide you through the process.
- **Dynamic API Understanding**: Parses `openai.json` to understand API endpoints and capabilities.
- **Custom Code Generation**: Uses OpenAI to generate an application tailored to your needs in the programming language of your choice.
- **Handles API Limitations**: Clearly identifies and informs you of any API constraints.
- **Project Output**: Automatically creates project files and organizes them in an output folder.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16.x or higher).
- **NPM**: Comes bundled with Node.js.
- **OpenAI API Key**: Get your API key from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/).

---

### 2. Installation

1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aigod452/openai-json-dev-builder.git
   cd openai-json-dev-builder
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure your OpenAI API key**:
   - Open `config/config.js`.
   - Replace `your_openai_api_key` with your actual OpenAI API key:
     ```javascript
     module.exports = {
       openaiApiKey: 'your_openai_api_key',
       outputDirectory: '../output',
       openaiModel: 'text-davinci-003',
     };
     ```

4. *(Optional)* Use environment variables with `.env`:

   - Install `dotenv`:
     ```bash
     npm install dotenv
     ```
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
     ```plaintext
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
     ```
   - Update `config/config.js` to use the environment variable:
     ```javascript
     require('dotenv').config();
     module.exports = {
       openaiApiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
       outputDirectory: '../output',
       openaiModel: 'text-davinci-003',
     };
     ```

### 3. Usage

Follow these steps to use the application:

1. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   node ./src/index.js
   ```

2. **Answer the prompts**:

   - **Step 1**: Provide the `openai.json` URL. This URL should point to the API documentation in JSON format.
     - Example: `https://example.com/openai.json`.
   - **Step 2**: Describe what you want to build.
     - Example: *“A chatbot that helps users schedule meetings”*.
   - **Step 3**: Choose your programming language.
     - Options: `JavaScript`, `Python`, `Go`, `Java`.
   - **Step 4**: Enter a name for your application.
     - Example: `MeetingSchedulerBot`.

3. **Wait for the application to process**:

   - The program fetches the `openai.json` file.
   - It uses OpenAI to generate the application based on your description and the API documentation.
   - All files are written to the `/output` folder.

4. **Access your generated application**:

   - Navigate to the `/output` directory:
     ```bash
     cd output/<YourAppName>
     ```

### 4. Example Usage

#### Input:
```plaintext
Enter the openai.json URL: https://example.com/openai.json
What do you want to build? A weather app that shows current conditions using the API
What programming language do you want to use? JavaScript
What is the name of your application? WeatherApp
```

#### Output:
Generated files in `output/WeatherApp`:
- `app.js`: The complete application code.
- Additional files (if required).

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

- **Node.js Version Error**: Ensure you’re using Node.js `v16.x` or higher.
- **`openai.json` Fetch Error**: Verify the URL is correct and accessible.
- **Missing OpenAI API Key**: Check that your API key is correctly set in `config/config.js` or `.env`.

---

## 🌐 How It Works

1. **Fetch API Documentation**:
   - The application downloads the `openai.json` file to understand the API’s endpoints, parameters, and capabilities.

2. **Understand User Requirements**:
   - You provide a description of what you want to build (e.g., "A chatbot for booking flights").

3. **Generate Code**:
   - The program sends the API documentation and your description to OpenAI.
   - OpenAI generates the code in the specified programming language.

4. **Handle Limitations**:
   - If OpenAI identifies API limitations, it explains them in the generated code or the output.

5. **Save Output**:
   - All generated files are saved in the `/output` folder.
